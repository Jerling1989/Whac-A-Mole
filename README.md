# Whac-A-Mole
Here is a game I made with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. This game was made with the intention of creating a simple game with some humor added to it. It is not a political statement, may someone find themselves offended. The game is "White House Whac-A-Mole" where White House staff members randomly display on the screen and the user scores points by how quickly they click on them.
